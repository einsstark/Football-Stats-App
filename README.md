This is a small app where I add football teams, edit their season stats, and see the results on a web page. I built it to practice a full-stack flow with a real database: store data, read it through an API, and show it in the browser.

**Why I built this**

I want a clean example that saves data, returns it without surprises, and keeps the screen in sync with the database. This repo shows that end-to-end.
