Football Stats (React + Node + MongoDB)

Small app to add teams, edit their season stats, and read simple numbers.
I built it to practice a basic full-stack flow with a real database.

Why I built this

I wanted a simple app that saves data, not just prints it.

I wanted clear routes to get and change data.

I wanted a basic screen that shows whatâ€™s in the database.

What it does

Add / edit / delete football teams.

Get first 10 teams.

Get average goals by year.

Get stats for one team.

See results on a web page.

Tech (kept simple)

Frontend: React, Axios

Backend: Node.js, Express

Database: MongoDB (local)

Prerequisites

Node 18+

MongoDB running on localhost:27017 (check with Compass if you want)
